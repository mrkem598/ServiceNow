If you find yourself unable to import your repository due to the presence of files edited outside an instance of ServiceNow, merge commits that mix files from different revisions, or other data that does not match the checksum, you may recover using either of the following techniques:
* Remove the problem commits:
  1. Clone your repository to a personal computer with the git command line tools installed and open a git command prompt in the repository root
  2. Run `git log` and take note of the SHA1s of the problem commits
  3. Build revert commits using `git revert SHA1` repeatedly, working backward in time, for each commit that introduced changes not generated by a ServiceNow instance
  4. Run `git push`

GlideAggregate
***
GlideAggregate help easily create database aggregation queries.

The scoped GlideAggregate class is an extension of GlideRecord and provides database aggregation (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG) queries. This functionality can be helpful when creating customized reports or in calculations for calculated fields. The GlideAggregate class works only on number fields.
```
var count = new GlideAggregate('incident');
count.addAggregate('COUNT');
count.query();
var incidents = 0;
if (count.next()) {
   incidents = count.getAggregate('COUNT');
}
//Number of incidents varies depending on the current state
//of the incident table
gs.info('Number of incidents: ' + incidents);
```
**
* Overwrite the problem code snapshot with a known good one:
  1. Clone your repository to a personal computer with the git command line tools installed and open a git command prompt in the repository root,
  2. Locate a known good code snapshot and record its SHA1. For this step, `git log` can be useful.
  2. Run `git reset --hard SHA1` to a commit that was generated by a ServiceNow instance
  3. Run `git reset HEAD{1}`
  4. Run `git add -A`
  5. Run `git commit`
  6. Run `git push`
